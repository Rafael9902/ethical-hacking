# What is information gathering?
- Is the first step in penetretion testing and is the act of gathering data our target.
It can be any type of data that we might find useful for a future attack.

## Types
There are two types of information gathering:

### Active
- We use kali linux(or any one tool) and try to get as much data or information about the target without interact with it. Also be a network, etc.
- The important here is that we get the information directly from the target, it may be exchanging packages, visiting and enumerate the website or talk to an employee(social engineering)
- It can be legal to an extent, if we start some advanced scan or OS fingerprint on the target, it canÂ´t be do without permission
- Provide us more important data or information that passive gathering

### Passive
- Similar to active in having a tool like kali linux and a target, but we also have an intermediate system(middle source),
this middle source can be anything, since a search engine to a website, person


## Goals
Wich are the goasl of it? wich information could be valuable to us?
- Usually the first thing that we search to identify a target is their IP address or addresses, then the technology of the company
like networks they have, softwares running, OS, programming languages
