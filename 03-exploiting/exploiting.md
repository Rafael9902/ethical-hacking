## Exploitation
- After get information about the target(whatweb, netdiscover, nmap, nessus. etc...), we have to hack the target with that information
- Exploit is the process where we use a vulnerability discovered to send somethiing called payload(program that we delivered to the target after the exploit, usually is something that execute commands on target systems and navigte throught files and folder)

### Payload
- program that we delivered to the target after the exploit, usually is something that execute commands on target systems and navigte throught files and folder

#### Steps
- Exploiting the target and send shell or payload with it
- Tell to the target to allow to connect to the other machine(our machine) and allow it to execute comman on your system
- Send the commands to target to execute

However, there is one problem with this, it scenario only work ifthe target has a vulnerability, if the target doesnÂ´t have a vulnerability we have to deliver the payload in other way(social engineer by example)


**Reverse Shells**
--
- Shells are our access to the target machine, with shells we execute commands and control the target system, so shell is our payload, however, there are two types of shells

+ Reverse Shells = Target machine trying to connect to our machine, for this our machine must be listening for the incoming connection over some port

+ Bind Shells = The target machine open the port for us, so the target machine is listening, not us, and we have to connect to that port

+ in a nutshell, reverse shell is the target connecting to the attack machine, and this last one listening in a port. Bind shells is target machine listening in a port and attacker connecting to that

+ We have a problem with bind shell, the firewall could forbif target machines to open a port, much firewall have a rule to not open random ports for security reasons, however the reverse shell always work because the target is just connecting to us

+ Rever shell is the best option
